Hi, Iâ€™m Kutlu Sezen ðŸ‘‹

I am a Data Analytics student soon to be an Data Analyst. Also a Mining Engineer worked in Turkey and the Middle East.

As an engineer who is working with data and decided to change his career, I thought that I want to continue working with data and prosper in recent technological advancements. I worked in/with various departments during my career and it helped me a lot in seeing things from a different point of view.

I like working in a multicultural environment and learn from different perspectives and solutions of colleagues of diverse backgrounds.
I value lifelong learning and benefit from different skill sets in problem-solving.

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in mastering SQL, R and MS Excel for my analysis.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python.
