Hi, I’m Kutlu Sezen 👋

I am a Data Analytics student soon to be an Data Analyst. Also an engineer worked in the mining sector in Turkey and the Middle East.

As an engineer who was working with data, I decided to direct my career into a new path and I thought that I want to continue working with data and prosper in recent technological advancements. I worked in/with various departments during my career and it helped me a lot in seeing things from a different point of view.

I like working in a multicultural environment and learn from different perspectives and solutions of colleagues of diverse backgrounds.
I value lifelong learning and benefit from different skill sets in problem-solving.

- 👀 I’m interested in mastering SQL, R and MS Excel for my analysis.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python.
