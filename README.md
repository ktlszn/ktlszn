Hi, Iâ€™m Kutlu Sezen ðŸ‘‹

I am a Data Analyst and an engineer experienced in the resource sector in Turkey and the KSA.

As an engineer who was working with data, I decided to direct my career into a new path and I thought that I want to continue working with data and prosper in recent technological advancements. I worked in/with various departments during my career and it helped me a lot in seeing things from a different point of view.

I like working in a multicultural environment and learn from different perspectives and solutions of colleagues of diverse backgrounds.
I value lifelong learning and benefit from different skill sets in problem-solving.

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in mastering SQL, Python and R for my analysis.
